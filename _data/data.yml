          company: Infosys Ltd, Bangalore
          details: Lead the development of recommendation engine based on probabilistic matrix factorization technique. The implementation was multi-threaded which exploits multi-cores available to java virtual machine. Few data structures are built from scratch to support memory and time efficiency. The implementation was lightweight on memory requirement and efficient in computation time. This recommendation engine was designed to power various eCommerce products which requires recommendation functionality. As part of this work we have also compared and benchmarked our algorithm with stock open source algorithm from Apache Mahout. Explored other machine learning algorithms on personal capacity like Logistic Regression, K-means, PageRank and Naive Bayes Classifier.
